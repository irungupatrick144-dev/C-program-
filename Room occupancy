    Description:
 2D array to represent room occupancy in one hotel branch.
    The hotel has 5 floors and each floor has 10 rooms.
    The user enters 1 if the room is occupied and 0 if it is vacant.
    The program then counts and displays how many rooms are occupied and vacant
    on each floor.
